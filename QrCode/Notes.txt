* Load all initial data (subscriptions) in shell, not in subscriptions, to avoid waiting time after the progress bar disappears. 
* In viewmodel: use initialized flag to avoid server lookups when data has already been fetched (refetch can the be forced when needed).
* Use model classes (models/subscription) that take a json model object and convert it to an observable (possibly by using the mapping plugin). 
  The model classes will also add all required computed functions. 
  This can be used for turning single subscriptoins into observables, and only updating the relevant one after a scan?
